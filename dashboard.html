       <p class="welcommsg">With the rise in the need of medicines during pandemic, rise of counterfeit medicines were observed as well!
    Counterfeit medicines are made in such a way that they are 
    almost impossible to differentiate by just looking at the package. <br><br> It can be hazardous to consume such medicines.
    And Thus, We are making a medicine verification system through which trusted Manufacturers can register their medicines which will
    be then added to immutable blockchain, for these blocks unique QR code will be made, scanning which consumer can ensure
    authenticity.
